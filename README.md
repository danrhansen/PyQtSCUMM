# PyQtSCUMM

This is a quick and dirty prototype of a 2D adventure game engine developed using PyQt6 in Python. I completed an online tutorial and thought as a training project because of some similar game development Iâ€™ve done as a hobby. I am a big fan of point-and-click adventure games most people remember from the late 80s and 90s. I experimented with MVC vs Model View architecture thinking I might like some more flexibility with different UI designs. There is a lot to make it a complete game prototype, but I had fun with it thus far. I also took a good amount of help from Chat GPT to shore up my understanding of Python.
